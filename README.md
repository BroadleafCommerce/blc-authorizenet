=============

Broadleaf Commerce currently offers integration with Authorize.net using the following two methods.

- Direct Post Integration Method for silent post/transparent redirect and reduced PCI compliance for AUTH_ONLY and AUTH_CAPTURE.
- Advanced Integration Method for more advanced transaction methods of PRIOR_AUTH_CAPTURE, VOID, and REFUND and increased PCI compliance for AUTH_ONLY and AUTH_CAPTURE.

> Note: As per the Authorize.net docs on AIM, transactions submitted to the test environment using a developer test account are not submitted to financial institutions for authorization and are not stored in the Merchant Interface.

For instruction on how to integrate this module into your Broadleaf project, please follow our integration guide here: http://docs.broadleafcommerce.org/current/Authorize.net-Module.html
